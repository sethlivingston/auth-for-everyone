# Introduction

### What is auth?

**Auth** is nickname for a big bucket of concepts, guidelines, and technologies used to make computer systems **secure**.

### What makes a computer system secure?

A secure computer system has three important characteristics:

1. Only humans with explicit permission may use the system.
1. Some humans have restrictions on what they may see and do with the system.
1. No one may circumvent #1 and #2 or otherwise disrupt usage of the system.

Everything you’ll read about in this book supports one, two, or all three of those characteristics.
