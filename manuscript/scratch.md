# How to storm a castle without an army

Imagine your software system is a castle. It's a safe place for its people (users) and its treasures (features and data). Everyone in the castle is happy and performs valuable tasks.

Now imagine you live outside the castle. Instead of wearing regal castle clothes, you wear a dark, hooded cloak. You're not a citizen of the castle; you're an enemy. A spy. An instigator.

Your goal is to storm the castle and steal its treasures. And if you can't steal it's treasures, then you'll settle with disrupting the castle's operations.

But how? The castle walls are nearly indestructible. You don't have an army. You don't have catapults. You don't even have a sword!

That’s okay. It turns out that raising armies and attacking castle walls is incredibly expensive and time-consuming anyway. There are better ways to storm a castle.

Let’s take a step back and think about what makes castles and software systems secure in the first place. Sure, the walls are important, but they’re there for armies. We’re interested in what makes them secure against sneakier threats, like spies and hackers.

We meet in a dark corner of a nearby tavern. We enjoy a buttered beer and some small talk. Then we clear the old wooden table and get to work.

## What makes castles and software systems secure?

There are three characteristics of castles and software systems that make them “secure”.

1. Only known citizens may enter the castle
2. Citizens are restricted on what they can do and see inside the castle
3. TBD

Let’s examine each characteristic.

### Characteristic #1: Only known citizens may enter the castle

You can’t just stroll into a castle wearing a hooded cloak and a dark demeanor. The castle guards will stop you, attempt to identify you, and then determine if you’re allowed to proceed through the gates.

Software systems have guards, too. Some systems have lax guards, like Google Search, which anyone may use. And some systems have more restrictive guards, like systems that store military secrets.

Guarding the gates is called authentication.

**Definition: Authentication**


> **Authentication** is the process of verifying that someone entering the system is a recognized user and is who they say they are.
