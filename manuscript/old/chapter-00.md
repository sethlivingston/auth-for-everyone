# Introduction

Welcome to Auth for Everyone.

**Auth** is a general term for a bucket of concepts, jargon, guidelines, acronyms, technologies, and algorithms used to help make computer systems secure.

That's a big bucket. It wasn't always that big, though. What happened?

## How we got here

I started my professional programming career in 1998. During 1990's and into the 2000's, the auth bucket was smaller. No matter what your role was in software development, you probably got by just fine without knowing what was in the auth bucket. Those were the salad days: our approach to security was carefree and our software was... catastrophically vulnerable. And then two seismic shifts changed the landscape forever.

First, some enterprising people figured out how to turn software vulnerabilities into a profitable business. The age of hackers and cybercrime was born. Teenagers were stealing hundreds of millions of credit card numbers from major retailers—a crime that was unheard of a decade earlier (Ederly 2010). It took corporations, governments, and the software development industry a long time to get serious about catching up, and they're still behind the game.

And that's how auth got so big and complicated. Everything in the auth bucket is there because software is vulnerable, and, to make matters worse, it's all connected and accessible in the cloud.



## Auth is for everyone

`TODO: why everyone should know auth at some level (tie back to hackers and cloud)`

Learning auth is important, but it's not easy. If you're not a programmer, you'll find scarce few books, articles, and videos that explain auth in plain English (or in plain any other language). If you are a programmer, there's plenty of content for you, but you're in for some challenging, dry reading. See the sources at the end of the book for some prime examples.

This book explains everything in the auth bucket in plain English, and it's for everyone in software development: programmers and non-programmers alike.
